This group assignment made me realize that design comes from life. The essence of design is to draw inspiration and creativity from life. It means paying attention to and understanding various elements, emotions and needs in daily life during the creative process, and using this as a basis to create practical and meaningful works. To meet people's needs and expectations. Design should not be divorced from reality, but should reflect all aspects of society, culture and individual life. By paying attention to people's behaviors, habits, desires, and challenges, design can better meet users' needs and provide better experiences.
