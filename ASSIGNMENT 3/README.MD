This made me think more deeply about my future employment. Computer majors have a wide range of employment opportunities in modern society because computer technology has penetrated into all walks of life. Computer science graduates are in great demand in fields such as software development, network management, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. At the same time, different positions require different skills, so when choosing employment, we should ensure that our skills match the field we choose. Continuous learning and updating of skills is important to stay competitive in a competitive market. On the other hand, obtaining relevant industry certifications, such as Cisco, Microsoft, AWS, etc., can improve my professionalism in specific fields and increase employers' trust in me. In addition, I can also consider starting a business or developing independently. If you have a creative and entrepreneurial spirit, consider starting your own technology company or participating in innovative projects. Overall, students majoring in computer science have good employment prospects now and in the future, but the key to success lies in continuous learning, adapting to market demands, and continuously improving their skill levels.
