In exploring existing health apps such as MyFitnessPal, we drew inspiration that aligns with our prototype, "My Wellness Buddy," particularly in the realm of video-based workouts.

Key Insights:
MyFitnessPal's Video Workout Integration: Its effective utilization of video workouts resonates with our approach in "My Wellness Buddy". We aim to offer a diverse library of video-based exercises tailored to individual needs.
Personalized Experience: Both MyFitnessPal and our prototype prioritize personalized user experiences, ensuring that each user’s fitness journey is uniquely tailored from the outset.
Our Unique Additions:
My Wellness Buddy distinguishes itself with real-time updates on the Homepage and a "My Plan" feature enabling users to create personalized workout schedules based on their preferred video exercises.

Future Direction:
Building on the success of MyFitnessPal and other platforms, our focus is to enhance My Wellness Buddy’s workout section by integrating a wider range of video workouts. By expanding this library and refining the user experience, we aim to create a comprehensive fitness application that combines personalized guidance with a rich variety of video-based exercises for users' benefit.
